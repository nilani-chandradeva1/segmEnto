# segmEnto

<!-- badges: start -->

**NOTE: this package is in its early phase of development...stay tuned!

The goal of segmEnto is to show how mosquito behaviour surveillance can be simplified by trapping mosquitoes over longer time segments, rather than every hour. In this package, you can test the influence of your time segments of choice on the estimate of an important metric - the proportion of bites averted by insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) - phi-B. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of segmEnto from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nilani-chandradeva1/segmEnto")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(segmEnto)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
